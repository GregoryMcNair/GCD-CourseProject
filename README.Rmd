# run_analysis.R

Takes data collected from accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
and creates two tidy data sets:

* One raw data, `final.csv`, set containing all mean and standard deviation measurements
* One data set, `averages.csv`, containing means of all other values, grouped by subject ID.

# Background of accelerometer measurements:

The accelerometer is a built-in component for measuring the acceleration of any
mobile device. Motions like swinging, tilting, rotating, shaking is detected
using accelerometer. The value of XYZ is used to calculate and detect the
motions. Besides mobile, the accelerometer is used to measure vibration on cars,
machines, buildings, process control systems and safety installations.
